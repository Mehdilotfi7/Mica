What i have done?
1. add _ before each module to have the new way of developing the package and the old one.
   - using multipatch for defing and simulating the modules.
   - Tested Model simulation module in _runtests.jl file.
   - removed segmen_loss from objective function module and let users totally define the loss function by themselves.
2. create the _runtests.jl in a very pretty way.
3. Github page updated and push pull commits work properly.

ToDo list:
1. find a better way to handle different dataset slicing for different dimention and simulation diffierent models in segmentation for loop.
2. After completing objective function module, test it in _runtests.jl.

What i have done?
1. Thought about designing the objective function module with a simple and readible way and came up with this idea that i need to have a data
handeling module as follows:  
   - It accepts datatype as vector, vector of vector, matrix and dataframe and return a matrix in all cases this make easier in objective function to do segmentation with single line and avoid date type extraction.
   - For now I skip the interpolation of missing values, but for later i can think of adding that as well.
2. differnt length of vectors when we have vector of vectors arise mismatch issue when computation of loss value, so i need to give an example 
in objective function module to guide the users.

ToDo list:
1. find a better way to handle different dataset slicing for different dimention and simulation diffierent models in segmentation for loop.
2. After completing objective function module, test it in _runtests.jl.

What i have done?
1. _ModelHandling module added tot ease the way of argument definind and not to have a need for model argument specification 
I will use this inside objective function
2. updated objective functoion:
   - now it has less arguments.  initial_conditions=nothing, extra_data=nothing, num_steps=nothing, tspan=nothing removed and handled by _ModelHandling module 
   - compare_variables=nothing, transformation=identity should be handled by user defined losss function.

ToDo list:
1. test _ModelHandling module and see if fits my goal
2. understand segment_model function
3. test objective function 
4. the current issue lies in simulation of model inside a given segment and data segmentation process for a segment and updating initial 
conditions if applicable to a model
   - what can I do is to handle them using a helper function for each and especially for segment simulation and data segmentation and 
   pass them as arguments to the loss function 
   - for initial conditions updating i need to also use a helper function similar to get initial condition function

1. what can I do is to handle them using a helper function for each and especially for segment simulation and data segmentation and 
   pass them as arguments to the loss function  -----> done
2. for initial conditions updating i need to also use a helper function similar to get initial condition function ----> done

ToDo list:
in the current version of runtests.jl in testing of _ModelHandling mudule it just tests the simulate_model not its helper functtions
also i need to know the rule of parnames.

13.05.2025
What i have done?
1. _ModelHandling mudule helper functions are tested now for three types of models.
2.  now I know the rule of parnames. and that is naming the parameters in each segment.
3. objective function module helper functions are tested now.
4. _ChangePointDetection module updated to use model handeling and objective function module and have less arguments to find out the model type, ....
5. - optimize_with_changepoints and update_bounds! are tested with no change point option.

ToDo list:
1. test evaluate_segment function with some change points for all three models.
2. test detect_changepoints for all three models and see the run time as well.

3. I need to double check all functions arguments type.
4. move extra files to another folder just keep modules files in this directory.
5. finalize the package.
6. Find out the real time docstring monitoring.

What i have done?
1. now the codes are working for ode but it is really slow
2. for solving this issue, i created a objective function using the original working code, but the problem is still there.
 

ToDo list:

1. re design the objective function from the working code and figure out the source of killing performance.
2. test the working code for large covid model.

What i have done?
1. now the codes are working for ode but it is really slow --------> i figured it out why it is runnung slow:  it is because of 
   paprameter definition in ODE model. since i am using LArray i needed to can parameters as p.beta p.gamma in model definition
2. for solving this issue, i created a objective function using the original working code, but the problem is still there. -----> this is also solved
3. re design the objective function from the working code and figure out the source of killing performance. ----> done
 

ToDo list:

1. redefine the parameters type for LArray whichever is needed 
2. think of initial setup, especially for parameters definition.
3. think of the best parameter type (LArray, dic, plain vector, ComponentArrays) for passing to ODEProblem.  LArray or simple plain vector is the first choice.

What i have done?
1. redefine the parameters type for LArray whichever is needed ----> i defined the parameters type as LArray inside objective function 
2. think of initial setup, especially for parameters definition. -----> for now i define them as plain array and parnames as (:a,:b)
3. think of the best parameter type (LArray, dic, plain vector, ComponentArrays) for passing to ODEProblem.  LArray or simple plain vector is the first choice. -----> LArray is the best option

ToDo list:

1. do the changes in modules for ode model and other modules.
2. test the modules for two other models 
3. complete the docstrings 
4. find the way of seeing preview of documentaions 
5. the problem with ode change point detection is, it cannot find all true change points.

What i have done?
1. for ode sample model it cannot detect all true cange points and the change point located in time point 150 is missing.
2. in the current version i use a fixed penalty value which does not make sense ---> should be number of change point dependant penalty term.
3. do the changes in modules for ode model and other modules. ---> done
4. test the modules for two other models.----> for DE model it is working, but i assume that extra data has two elements.

ToDo list:

1. complete the docstrings 
2. find the way of seeing preview of documentaions 
3. the problem with ode change point detection is, it cannot find all true change points.
4. implement this penalty term in objective function? or in the current version place? are they doing the same thing?
   penalty_BIC(change_points) = p/2*log(size(data, 2)) * length(change_points)
5. visualisation of change point detection: create the visualisation module to plot the change points in each step 
   this is similar to objective function but the difference is to instead of computing loss we use append! to collect all sampes for all segments 
   and then plot them!!!!

   What i have done?
   1. for ode sample model it cannot detect all true cange points and the change point located in time point 150 is missing. ----> it was about GA properties 
   3. the problem with ode change point detection is, it cannot find all true change points. ----> now it finds but have some additional change points 
   4. test the modules for two other models.----> for DE model it is working, but i assume that extra data has two elements.
   5. implement this penalty term in objective function? or in the current version place? are they doing the same thing?
   penalty_BIC(change_points) = p/2*log(size(data, 2)) * length(change_points) ------> implemented, but with full BIC CP,n,n_segPars it only detects the change point 50
   but with other options, the result is like there is no penalty term.
   
   ToDo list:
   
   1. i should add the estimation of previous segment pars as initial guesses for next segment
   2. try to define appropriate penalty term. in evaluate_segment function or or objective function??
   3. complete the docstrings 
   4. find the way of seeing preview of documentaions 
   5. visualisation of change point detection: create the visualisation module to plot the change points in each step

 - penalty term: BIC with a weight or using a penalty that account for sigment imbalance 
 - set seed : pay attention to numbers or the place where to put set.seed
 - step size : by changing the step size detected cahnge points are changing and even in some cases, with very less
   num step it just detect very less change points ---> unexpected 
- test solutions from chatGPT



31.05.2025
- I workd on documentation:
- the template is ready and i can access to local web interface but 
- on github, gh-pages files are missing at the moment; I need to think about 
  that or ask Johanness

02.06.2025
- i am not sure again if i put penalty term in ibjective function or in ChangePointDetection function
- tested ChangePointDetection fuction, in any case it detect 190 first 
- test the same penalty in objective function (Euclidian distance of parameters values)

04.06.2025
- change the population size to 150, this gives more chance to GA to find the global optimum for short segments
- now with BIC penalizing with lambda=100, i get only true change points without extra change points
- now i need to do benchmarking and repreduce the results of paper 
- I want to also integrate the PELT methods

05.06.2025
- i defined penalty.jl module to handle the author defined penalty function ---> done
- now i need to do benchmarking and repreduce the results of paper --> Covid ---> wind turbine
- I want to also integrate the PELT methods

05.06.2025

benchmarking for first iterations where datalength is 70 is slow and does not find any change points
but when i run it without benchmarking just testing with the less time points as before it finds 50 and some 
more also it is fast. i think the proble is with benchmarking 
- is there any julia package to do this?
- if not how can i make the benchmarking clean
- is the current benchmarking making sense? or should i change my benchmarking criteria?

08.06.2025

- benchmarking worked perfectly and got the result 
- i stick to the corrent criteria for benchmarking 
- now need to visualise the results for accuracy and run time in heatmap 
- should i visualize all combination data,sim,cps for supp material?

08.06.2025

- now need to visualise the results for accuracy and run time in heatmap ---> done nicely 
- should i visualize all combination data,sim,cps for supp material?   ----> done
- running small covid model.
- then wind turbine model.
- run benchmarking for different penalty type and BIC_10,20,30,...,100?
