What i have done?
1. add _ before each module to have the new way of developing the package and the old one.
   - using multipatch for defing and simulating the modules.
   - Tested Model simulation module in _runtests.jl file.
   - removed segmen_loss from objective function module and let users totally define the loss function by themselves.
2. create the _runtests.jl in a very pretty way.
3. Github page updated and push pull commits work properly.

ToDo list:
1. find a better way to handle different dataset slicing for different dimention and simulation diffierent models in segmentation for loop.
2. After completing objective function module, test it in _runtests.jl.

What i have done?
1. Thought about designing the objective function module with a simple and readible way and came up with this idea that i need to have a data
handeling module as follows:  
   - It accepts datatype as vector, vector of vector, matrix and dataframe and return a matrix in all cases this make easier in objective function to do segmentation with single line and avoid date type extraction.
   - For now I skip the interpolation of missing values, but for later i can think of adding that as well.
2. differnt length of vectors when we have vector of vectors arise mismatch issue when computation of loss value, so i need to give an example 
in objective function module to guide the users.

What i have done?
1. _ModelHandling module added tot ease the way of argument definind and not to have a need for model argument specification 
I will use this inside objective function
2. updated objective functoion:
   - now it has less arguments.  initial_conditions=nothing, extra_data=nothing, num_steps=nothing, tspan=nothing removed and handled by _ModelHandling module 
   - compare_variables=nothing, transformation=identity should be handled by user defined losss function.

ToDo list:
1. test _ModelHandling module and see if fits my goal
2. understand segment_model function
3. test objective function 
4. the current issue lies in simulation of model inside a give segment and data segmentation process for a segment and updating initial 
conditions if applicable to a model
   - what can I do is to handle them using a helper function for each and especially for segment simulation and data segmentation and 
   pass them as arguments to the loss function 
   - for initial conditions updating i need to also use a helper function similar to get initial condition function
