What i have done?
1. add _ before each module to have the new way of developing the package and the old one.
   - using multipatch for defing and simulating the modules.
   - Tested Model simulation module in _runtests.jl file.
   - removed segmen_loss from objective function module and let users totally define the loss function by themselves.
2. create the _runtests.jl in a very pretty way.
3. Github page updated and push pull commits work properly.

ToDo list:
1. find a better way to handle different dataset slicing for different dimention and simulation diffierent models in segmentation for loop.
2. After completing objective function module, test it in _runtests.jl.
